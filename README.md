# SymC in Chemistry  
## Critical Damping as the Governing Principle of Catalysis and Reactivity

Chemical reactivity across electron transfer (ET), proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET),  
and heterogeneous catalysis can be organized by a single stability ratio

\[
\chi = \frac{\Gamma}{2\Omega}
\]

where \(\Gamma\) is the dissipation rate and \(\Omega\) is the characteristic frequency  
of the reactive mode.

## Core Insight

Reactivity is maximized when the system approaches the near-critical regime

\[
\chi \approx 1
\]

This point marks optimal dynamical stability, maximal information throughput,  
and minimal distortion—consistent with the Symmetrical Convergence (SymC) framework  
across physics, biology, and complex systems.

## 1. Electron Transfer (ET)

- **Adiabatic ET:** \(\chi > 1\)  
  Overdamped, environment-dominated dynamics.

- **Nonadiabatic ET:** \(\chi < 1\)  
  Underdamped, structure-dominated dynamics.

This unifies Marcus regimes under a single dynamical parameter.

## 2. Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer (PCET)

Mechanism selection follows from the motion of \(\chi\):

- **Concerted PCET:** \(\chi\) remains within the adaptive window.  
- **Stepwise PCET:** \(\chi\) oscillates through underdamped / overdamped regions.

The framework replaces mechanism lookup tables with a stability criterion.

## 3. Heterogeneous Catalysis

Catalyst surfaces tune substrate \(\chi\). Examples:

- **TEMPO self-exchange:** \(k_{et} \propto 1/\tau_L\) across solvents.  
- **N\(_2\)** dissociation on Fe: barrier drop from 1.1 eV (Fe(110)) to 0.3 eV (Fe(111))  
  tracks the shift of \(\chi \rightarrow 1\).

The Sabatier principle becomes a case of critical-damping optimization.

## Why This Matters

The SymC approach:

- connects ET, PCET, and catalysis under a single mathematical rule,  
- provides falsifiable predictions for solvent effects, isotope shifts, and spectra,  
- reframes reactivity as a stability-controlled process,  
- removes artificial boundaries between mechanistic frameworks.

The result is a coherent, dynamical theory of chemical kinetics.
